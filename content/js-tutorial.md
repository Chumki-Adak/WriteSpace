# Introduction 

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is widely used for web development. It allows developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages. In this tutorial, we will explore the core concepts of JavaScript, starting from the basics and gradually moving to more advanced topics.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was originally developed for adding interactivity to web pages. It is an essential part of web development, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript can be used for both client-side and server-side programming, making it a powerful tool for developers.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before we dive into coding, we need to set up our development environment. You can write JavaScript code in any text editor, but using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code can enhance your productivity. Make sure to install Node.js if you want to run JavaScript on the server side.

  ```javascript
  let name = "John";
  const age = 30;
